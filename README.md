# SimpleSwitch

This is a simple magnetic switch for model rocketry (or other whatever other uses you may find). It is suitable for any load switching applications with a voltage range between ~3.3V and 24V and a load current of < ~4A continuous. The current draw in the off state should be ~3uA which should allow a 300mAh battery to last ~10 years before going completely flat. Of course in reality the leakage current of the battery itself will result in a significant reduction in this number.

## Operation

Use of the SimpleSwitch is easy. Bringing a magnetic south pole near the top of the board will result in the switch turning on and illuminating the power LED. The switch will stay on until a magnetic north pole is bought near the top of the board at which time the switch will turn off again. That's it.
